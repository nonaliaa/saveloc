plugin that aims to mimmick/improve the ksf timer's core saveloc functionality.

currently untested with multiple people on the server. if anyone tries this on a server with multiple people and encounters problems making an issue would be greatly appreciated.

likely won't be getting many more updates as i'll mainly be working on my [surftimer](https://github.com/nonaliaa/surf-tiemr) from now on.

#### commands 

- sm_saveloc (!saveloc)

    usage: sm_saveloc

    creates a "saveloc" or checkpoint that the player can teleport to at any time.
